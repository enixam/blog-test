I have made several [bookdown](https://bookdown.org/home/) projects to collect what I have learned and thoughts inspired by some excellent data science resources. As of yet most of them are written in Chinese, but I have decided to make English learning notes more often.   

* https://bookdown.org/Maxine/rfordatascience/ : Notes for [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/) by Hadley Wickham and Garret Grolemund. Topics covered in the original book are fairly reproduced and explored, and I now start to venture new topics based on some nice R packages I discoverd, as well as update some content to keep it in line with the newest [Tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/)  

* https://bookdown.org/content/3225/ : Where I share interesting and practical packages devoted to data visualizaiton in R, usally more advanced than basic ggplot graphics. I hope it could serve as a cookbook-like introduction to some geoms, theme settings, ggplot2 extensions, etc. This project arn't based on one specific book, but there are some enlightenment provided though: [R Graphics Cookbook](https://r-graphics.org/), [R Graph Gallery](https://www.r-graph-gallery.com), [Fundamentals of Data Visualization](https://serialmentor.com/dataviz/index.html).  
  There was also a project modelled on [R Graphics Cookbook](https://r-graphics.org/) covering ggplot2 basics. I made it when I was first exposed to ggplot2, and finally found it too gruelling to document it in minute, so I quit writing it as least for now. If you would like to take a look, see https://bookdown.org/Maxine/ggplot2_basics/  
 

* https://bookdown.org/Maxine/textmining/ : Notes for [Text Mining with R: A Tidy Approach](http://127.0.0.1:4321) by Julia Silge and David Robinson, this project is still under early development.  

* https://bookdown.org/Maxine/tidy_tuesday/ : Contributions to the [Tidy Tuesday Project](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday) launched by the [R for Data Science Online Learning Community](https://www.rfordatasci.com/)
